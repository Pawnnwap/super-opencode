# opencode-supervisor

---

[English](./README.md) | [中文](./README_zh.md)

Streamlit UI + modular Python backend that runs an `opencode` agent in a
supervised feedback loop — and can turn that same loop on **itself** to
debug and evolve its own source code.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- An API key for OpenAI or any compatible provider (e.g., NVIDIA NIM, Ollama)
- opencode CLI installed (see installation below)

---

## Windows Installation

To install opencode on Windows using Chocolatey:

```bash
choco install opencode
```

The executable is installed to `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\opencode.exe`.

For UI configuration, use the path `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\opencode.exe`.

---

## Free API Recommendations

- **[NVIDIA NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/models)** — Free tier available for AI model access
- **[IFlow CN](https://platform.iflow.cn/models)** — Free API for AI model access

---

## Recommended Models

### Supervisor Model
- With NVIDIA NIM: **nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b** or **qwen/qwen3.5-397b-a17b**
- With IFlow: **qwen3-coder-plus**

### opencode Model
- **opencode/big-pickle**

---

## Setup

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -e . --force-reinstall
```

> **Note:** `pip install -e .` is required so that the `supervisor` package is
> importable from anywhere — including when Streamlit launches `app.py` from
> a different working directory.

---

## Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

If the above command does not work, try:

```bash
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## What the Supervisor Does

The supervisor system runs the opencode agent in a controlled feedback loop:

1. **Protocol-driven execution** — A `protocol.md` file defines INPUT, TARGET,
   and RESTRICTIONS that guide the agent's behavior
2. **Real-time monitoring** — Context window usage is tracked and compaction
   triggers automatically when needed
3. **Workspace safety** — The system blocks out-of-workspace path references to
   prevent unintended modifications
4. **Checkpointing** — Every successful iteration is snapshotted to `.checkpoints/`
5. **Workspace archiving** — Workspace state is preserved in `.archive/` before
   each run and after each iteration
6. **Self-evolution** — The system can analyze and improve its own codebase,
   running tests before and after each change with automatic rollback on regression

---

## Streamlit UI Pages

### ① Protocol Wizard
Fill in INPUT / TARGET / RESTRICTIONS in plain language → click
**Refine with AI** → review the generated `protocol.md` → Accept & Save.

The wizard includes:
- **Configuration panel** — Set API key, base URL, workspace path, models,
  max retries, context threshold, timeout, max tokens
- **Protected Files** — Mark files that opencode cannot modify or delete
- **.opencodeignore** — Configure ignore patterns for files excluded from
  context retrieval
- **Live quality analysis** — Real-time scoring of protocol clarity,
  testability, and completeness as you type

### ② Live Run
Start the supervisor loop against any project workspace. Live log streams
in real time. Stop between steps at any time.

Features:
- Step-by-step progress tracking with phase detection
- Token usage warnings with graduated thresholds (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%)
- Verbose/compact log toggle
- Context compaction with file cleanup suggestions
- Heartbeat monitoring to detect stalled processes

### ③ Report
Final supervisor report after a run, with download button.

### ④ Self-Evolution
Point the system at **its own source tree**.

1. Describe what you want debugged or improved
2. Optionally add extra restrictions
3. **Generate meta_protocol.md** — LLM reads the live source and writes
   a precise protocol with accurate INPUT and testable TARGETs
4. Review / edit, then **Launch Evolution**

Self-evolution features:

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Test baseline | `pytest` (or syntax check) runs before opencode touches anything |
| Per-iteration tests | Tests re-run after every supervisor judgement |
| Regression guard | Tests worse → auto-rollback to last good checkpoint |
| Checkpointing | Every non-regressing iteration is snapshotted to `.checkpoints/` |
| Workspace archiving | Every iteration is archived to `.archive/` with metadata |
| Evolution report | `evolution_report.md` — changed files, test delta, best checkpoint |

## Protocol System

A `protocol.md` file is the core contract between you and the supervisor.
It must contain exactly three sections:

```markdown
## INPUT

Describe what already exists — files, directories, entry points, current state.

## TARGET

List numbered, testable deliverables the agent must produce.
Good: "All pytest tests in ./tests/ pass"
Bad: "the code should work"

## RESTRICTIONS

Hard rules the agent must never violate.
- Do not touch files outside ./src
- No system package installs
- Keep code under 300 lines
```

### Protocol Quality Analysis

The system analyzes protocol quality across three dimensions:
- **Clarity** — Avoids vague language, uses structured formatting
- **Testability** — Contains measurable acceptance criteria
- **Completeness** — Covers all necessary context and constraints

Quality ratings: `excellent` (≥90%) → `good` (≥75%) → `fair` (≥50%) → `poor`

---

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| API Key | — | Your API key (OpenAI or any compatible provider) |
| Base URL | *(blank = OpenAI)* | Override for local/proxy endpoints e.g. `http://localhost:11434/v1` |
| Workspace path | — | Absolute path to the project directory |
| Supervisor / wizard model | — | Any model string your provider accepts |
| opencode model | *(opencode default)* | Forwarded to the opencode CLI |
| Max retries | 3 | Consecutive failures before forced stop |
| Context threshold | 60% | Compaction fires at this fraction of estimated max |
| Max tokens | 128,000 | Model context window size |
| Timeout | 120 min | Silence before opencode is deemed unresponsive |
| Protected files | *(empty)* | User-defined files that opencode cannot modify |

### Advanced Configuration (SupervisorConfig)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| truncation_enabled | True | Enable prompt truncation when approaching limits |
| max_history_turns | 40 | Maximum conversation history turns before compaction |
| compact_intermediate_steps | False | Compact intermediate step outputs |
| max_protected_files_for_suggestions | 5 | Max protected files shown in suggestions |
| read_external_feedback | False | Allow external feedback injection |

## Workspace Protection

The supervisor enforces multiple layers of protection:

### System-Protected Directories
- `.opencode/` — Supervisor configuration (auto-created)
- `.checkpoints/` — System checkpoints
- `.archive/` — Version archives

### User-Protected Files
Mark specific files as read-only via the UI. These files are:
- Excluded from opencode's write operations
- Listed in every prompt sent to opencode
- Validated before any modification attempt

### .opencodeignore
Configure a `.opencodeignore` file in your workspace root to exclude files
from context retrieval. Supports:
- Exact filename matches: `debug.py`
- Prefix matches: `prefix*`
- Suffix matches: `*_test.py`
- Glob patterns: `**/*.pyc`
- Directory patterns: `build/`

---

## Context Monitoring

The supervisor tracks token usage with graduated warnings:

| Threshold | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 50% | Context usage noted |
| 60% | Approaching compaction threshold |
| 70% | Context elevated — monitor closely |
| 80% | Warning — compaction recommended |
| 90% | Critical — immediate compaction required |

Token estimation uses `tiktoken` (o200k_base encoding) when available,
falling back to character-based estimation (4 chars/token).

Automatic compaction triggers at the configured `context_threshold`
(default 60%), prompting opencode to clean up unnecessary files.

---

## Workspace Archiving

Every run preserves workspace state in `.archive/`:
- Archives are organized into `code/`, `results/`, `logs/`, `other/` subdirectories
- Metadata is stored in `archive_metadata.json`
- Archives are numbered with timestamps and a counter
- The `.archive/` directory itself is protected from modification
- Version files are never deleted — only archived

---

## Safety Features

1. **Workspace boundary enforcement** — All path references are validated
   against the workspace root
2. **Protected path detection** — System directories and user-protected
   files cannot be modified or deleted
3. **Protocol alignment verification** — Each iteration is checked against
   the protocol for compliance
4. **Regression testing** — Self-evolution compares test results against
   the baseline before accepting changes
5. **Automatic rollback** — Bad changes are reverted to the last good
   checkpoint
6. **Heartbeat monitoring** — Detects stalled processes and extends
   timeouts when progress is being made
7. **Archive preservation** — Historical versions are preserved, never deleted

---

## TODO

- [ ] Get rid of `pip install -e . --force-reinstall` so that every self evolution will be auto applied
- [ ] Add multi agent cooperation/competition
- [ ] Better timeout handling and process tracking
